# Simple_Linear_Regression
Used Python basic code to buld a linear Regression Algorithm to Predict the value of 'Y' for the user entered value of 'X', based on the training set ('X','Y') present in file "abc.csv".

# abc.csv
This is a file containing values of 'X' and 'Y'. If the file already has values present for 'X' and 'Y'(min 3 entries), Algorithm treat it as training set and try to predict answer for the new user value entered('X').
If the training set is empty or has less than 3 entries, user may enter training set to file "abc.csv" from the console.

# Direction to run code
-save "Simple_Linear_regression.py" and "abc.csv" to a same folder. (let say folder is .../Python)
-run python code from the console.
